# Local Whitelist Domains Error - Fixed!

## Problem
When running Email Guardian locally, you encountered this error:
```
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'whitelist_domains'
```

## âœ… Solution Applied

The issue was that the local version (`local_standalone.py`) was missing the whitelist domains functionality that exists in the main Replit version. 

### What Was Fixed:

1. **Added WhitelistDomain Model**: Complete database model for storing trusted domains
2. **Added Routes**: All necessary routes for whitelist management:
   - `/whitelist-domains` - Main management page
   - `/api/whitelist-domains` - API for loading/adding domains
   - `/api/whitelist-domains/<id>/toggle` - Toggle domain status
   - `/api/whitelist-domains/<id>` - Delete domains

3. **Database Initialization**: Automatic creation of default whitelist domains
4. **Fixed Navigation**: Template navigation now works correctly
5. **API Compatibility**: JSON responses match the Replit version exactly

## ðŸš€ How to Use the Fix

### Step 1: Stop Current Local Application
If you have the local Email Guardian running, stop it with `Ctrl+C`

### Step 2: Restart the Application
```bash
python local_standalone.py
```

You should see:
```
Adding default whitelist domains...
Added 3 default whitelist domains
Database tables created successfully!
Email Guardian is ready!
Access at: http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 3: Access Whitelist Management
Navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:5000/whitelist-domains

You should now see a professional whitelist management interface with:
- Statistics dashboard showing domain counts
- Table of all whitelist domains
- Add/edit/delete functionality
- Domain type categorization

## ðŸ“‹ Default Domains Added

The system automatically creates these trusted domains:
- `company.com` (Corporate)
- `corp.com` (Corporate)  
- `trusted-partner.com` (Corporate)

## ðŸ”§ Testing the Fix

Run the verification script:
```bash
python test_local_whitelist.py
```

This will confirm all whitelist functionality is properly installed.

## ðŸ“– Features Available

Your local Email Guardian now has full whitelist domain management:

### âœ… Management Interface
- Clean, professional UI matching the Replit version
- Add new trusted domains
- Edit domain types and notes

### âœ… API Endpoints

## ðŸŽ‰ Result
