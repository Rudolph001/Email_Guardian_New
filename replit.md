# Email Guardian - Email Security Analysis Platform

## Overview

Email Guardian is a comprehensive web application designed for analyzing Tessian email export data to detect security threats, data exfiltration attempts, and anomalous communication patterns. The platform combines rule-based filtering, machine learning analytics, and domain classification to provide enterprise-grade email security analysis.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

Email Guardian follows a modular Flask-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5 with Jinja2 templates, Chart.js for visualizations, DataTables for data display
- **Backend**: Flask web framework with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Database**: SQLite for development/local deployment (designed to support PostgreSQL migration)
- **ML Engine**: scikit-learn for anomaly detection, clustering, and pattern recognition
- **File Processing**: Chunked CSV processing with pandas for handling large datasets
- **Session Management**: JSON-based data persistence with gzip compression for large files

## Key Components

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline
- **DataProcessor**: Handles CSV file ingestion with chunked processing (2500 records per chunk)
- **SessionManager**: Manages data persistence, compression, and session lifecycle
- **Column Mapping**: Case-insensitive field matching for flexible CSV structures

### 2. Rule Engine System
- **RuleEngine**: Configurable business rules with complex AND/OR logic
- **Exclusion Rules**: Pre-processing filters to exclude known-good communications
- **Supported Operators**: equals, contains, regex patterns, range comparisons, list membership

### 3. Domain Classification
- **DomainManager**: Automated domain categorization (corporate, personal, public, suspicious)
- **Whitelist Management**: Trust-based domain filtering with recommendation engine
- **Trust Scoring**: Multi-factor domain reputation scoring

### 4. Machine Learning Analytics
- **MLEngine**: Core ML functionality with Isolation Forest for anomaly detection
- **AdvancedMLEngine**: Deep analytics including network analysis and pattern clustering
- **Risk Scoring**: Multi-dimensional risk assessment with configurable thresholds

### 5. Web Interface
- **Dashboard System**: Multiple specialized dashboards (main, sender analysis, time analysis, etc.)
- **Case Management**: Escalation tracking and investigation workflow
- **Administration Panel**: System configuration and rule management

## Data Flow

1. **Upload Phase**: CSV files uploaded and validated for structure
2. **Processing Phase**: Data chunked and processed through pipeline stages:
   - Column mapping and validation
   - Exclusion rule application
   - Whitelist filtering
   - ML analysis and risk scoring
3. **Storage Phase**: Results stored in SQLite with JSON session data (compressed for large datasets)
4. **Analysis Phase**: Multiple analytical views generated from processed data
5. **Presentation Phase**: Results displayed through responsive web dashboards

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework
- Flask: Web application framework
- SQLAlchemy: Database ORM
- Jinja2: Template engine

### Data Processing
- pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
- numpy: Numerical computing
- scikit-learn: Machine learning algorithms

### Frontend Libraries
- Bootstrap 5: UI framework

## Deployment Strategy

The application is designed for local deployment with the following characteristics:

- **Target Platforms**: Windows and Mac systems
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity (PostgreSQL-ready architecture)
- **Server**: Gunicorn on port 5000 (0.0.0.0:5000)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with organized directory structure
- **Session Management**: File-based with automatic compression
- **Configuration**: Environment variable based with sensible defaults

```

### Key Design Decisions

**Database Choice**: SQLite chosen for simplicity and portability, with architecture designed to easily migrate to PostgreSQL for production deployments.

**Chunked Processing**: 2500-record chunks balance memory usage with processing efficiency for large CSV files.

**Session-Based Architecture**: Each upload creates a persistent session allowing for iterative analysis and comparison across different datasets.

**Modular ML Pipeline**: Separate engines for basic and advanced analytics allow for scalable complexity based on analysis requirements.

**Flexible Rule System**: JSON-based rule configuration with runtime evaluation supports complex business logic without code changes.
